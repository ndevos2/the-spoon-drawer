<h1>Butternut Squash and Lentil Soup</h1>

<p>Prep time: ???? minutes. Cook time: ??? minutes. Total time: ???</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>1 Butternut squash (mine was 2.88 lbs/1.31 kg), cubed<br>
2 Yellow onions, rough chop<br>
2 c Dry red lentils<br>
2 Bay leaves<br>
4 tbsp Curry Powder<br>
6ish? cloves Garlic, minced<br>
1.5 inches Fresh ginger, grated<br>
Olive oil<br>
7.5 c Water<br>
3 Boullion cubes (I use chicken)</p>

<ol>
	<li>Heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook garlic until fragrant; add curry powder, ginger, stock cubes, and bay leaves.</li>
	<li>Add onion, cook until soft, stirring frequently.</li>
	<li>Add squash, mix to combine.</li>
	<li>Add water. Bring to boil, and reduce to simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until squash is fork-tender.</li>
	<li>Move off heat, and wait 10 minutes for the soup to cool.</li>
	<li>Transfer soup in batches to stand blender; bend until smooth. Alternatively, use an immersion blender, though it is harder to get a smooth blend this way.</li>
	<li>Return to pot, heat to serving temperature, and serve.</li>
</ol>

	Notes:<br>
