	<li>Once chillies are wilted, add garlic, ginger, and onion. Cook until onions are almsot brown but if you can't wait that's okay too.</li>
	<li>Add spices: garam masala, bay leaves, curry powder, ground cumin, chili powder, ground cinnamon, ground coriander, tumeric powder, and ground allspice. Toast until fragrant.</li>
	<li>Add tomatoes and stir to combine.</li>

	<li>Add chickpeas, and cook for another 10 minutes.</li>

	Notes:
	<ol>
		<li>This can be very spicy, so reduce chiies to preference (or increase!)</li>
		<li>Also really good with naan! And helps with spice</li>
	</ol>

	Future Iterations:
	<ol>
		<li>Try adding Fenugreek</li>
		<li>The warm spices seem to help with the heat, but also I think I did like 6 chilies the first time and it was RIP dead</li>
		<li>Needs..... like shredded chicken or something I think. Even like one breast would add a lot to the dish.</li>
