<h1>Baked Lemon Pepper Chicken and Rice</h1>

<p>Prep time: 20-30 minutes. Cook time: 45 minutes. Total time: around 1:15</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>3 chicken thighs (skin and bone in)<br>
2 tbsp lemon pepper seasoning (I use Cool Runnings)<br>
Olive oil<br>
1/3 c white wine<br>
2 tbsp unsalted butter<br>
1 chopped onion<br>
4???? garlic cloves<br>
1 1/2 c chicken stock<br>
3/4 c water<br>
Grated parmesan for garnish</p>

<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C).</li>
	<li>In a bowl, coat the thighs in the lemon pepper, focusing on the skin (should this really be done now, it just BURNS).</li>
	<li>Heat olive oil on medium in oven safe pan, and place thighs skin down. Cook for 3 minutes, flip and cook 3 minutes, then flip back to the skin and cook 2 minutes. Remove to bowl.</li>
	<li>Remove chicken from pan, and pour wine to deglaze.</li>
	<li>Melt butter in wine, stirring so it doesn't burn.</li>
	<li>Cook onion until translucent, then add 4 generous spoons of garlic. Add rice and stir frequently for 4 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add chicken stock and water and bring to simmer. Let simmer for 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Place chicken on top of rice mixture, pouring any chicken juices back into the pan.</li>
	<li>Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes, then remove foil and bake for 10 more minutes (a total time of 45 minutes).</li>
	<li>Fluff with spoon and let sit 5-10 minutes - this is about the time it will take to finish your sides and get the meal on the table. Grate parmesan onto rice to garnish.</li>
</ol>

	Notes:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>This is a very heavy meal. Very greasy, rich, salty. Very filling, and good when you're craving something heavy. Be warned, it's not for days when you want something light!</li>
