<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>1 lb peameal bacon<br>
2 tbsp butter<br>
2 leeks, sliced and rinsed<br>

2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
<b>6 cups</b> boiling potatoes (I use Yukon Gold), peeled and diced<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
1 tsp dried thyme<br>
1 tsp ground black pepper<br>
1/2 tsp salt (I did 40 turns of a salt grinder)<br>
5 cups stock (chicken or vegetable, or a combination. I did 2c Chicken, 3c Veg)<br>
1 can evaporated milk<br>
1 cup half-and-half</p>

<ol>

	<li>Add leek mixture, potatoes, stock, bay leaves, thyme, and salt and pepper to the crockpot. Cook on low for 6 hours or high for 4 hours.</li>
	<li>An hour before the soup is done, cook pemeal bacon in the oven for 45-60 minutes at 375 F. Allow to cool and dice.</li>
	<li>Remove <b>2 cups</b> of potatoes and the bay leaves, and use an immersion blender to blend until smooth.</li>

	<li>Add in diced peameal bacon and reserved potatoes.</li>
	<li>Serve.</li>
</ol>

	Notes:<br>
	<ul>
        <li>Using condensed milk isn't <i>terrible</i>, but it's certainly a different flavour.</li>
        <li>This is a peppery, warm soup!</li>
        <li>Try serving with breads and cheeses, with more bacon for garnish.</li>
        <li>Can use a fresh sprig of thyme - remove with the bay leaves.</li>
		<li>Recipe based on the Peameal Bacon Potato Chowder recipe shared by Ontario Pork: <a href="https://www.ontariopork.on.ca/recipes/Our-Blog/slow-cooker-peameal-and-potato-chowder">Slow Cooker Peameal and Potato Chowder</a> by Tara Ballantyne</li>
	</ul>
	Future Iteration Notes:
	<ol>
        <li>Needs more potatoes!!! Try 8 cups next time...</li>
        <li>Dice the potatoes smaller.</li>
        <li>Need to reserve more than 2 cups of potatoes for chunks.</li>
        <li>Possibly less milk.</li>
